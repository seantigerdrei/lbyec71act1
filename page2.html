			<p>Dear Reader,</p>
			<p>Last night, I had a beautiful dream. I was lost in a fog. I was wandering around, searching for something, only I didn’t know what it was exactly that I was searching for. Every face I saw was strange. Then all my darkest and loneliest moment I saw your face. You smiled at me, extended your hand and then we flew up together over the clouds and straight up towards the sun and the stars – twirling around and around – like two angels caught in a cosmic embrace.
			<br><br>
			Then I woke up and realized that this was no dream, I had been presented with the truth about you. Please take me up, my fiery angel, my beloved reader. Whenever you go, please take me with you. Please stay by my side and make me complete. My eyes need to see what you see, my ears hear what you hear and my soul feel what you feel.
			<br><br>
			Please tell me how you feel.
			<br><br>
			May the angels tuck you in at night.
			<br><br>
			Tiger Suico
